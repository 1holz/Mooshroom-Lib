This is a library for my minecraft mods.

This is the lite version of this mod.

It currently does this:  
- easier block (+ block entity, recipe, gui, etc.) and item registering  
- easier logger  
- easier and more advanced recipe handling

The deprecated full version additionally did this:
- easier and more advanced handling of containers
- some [CCA](https://github.com/OnyxStudios/Cardinal-Components-API) Component management
