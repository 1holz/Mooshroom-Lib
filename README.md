This is a library for my minecraft mods.

It currently does this:
- easier logger
- easier and more advanced recipe handling
- easier registering
- easier screen stuff
- easier and more advanced handling of containers and storages of the fabric transfer api
  - also adds Heat and Electricity storage stuff
- some very small utility stuff
